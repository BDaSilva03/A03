2. Open up webbrains on your computer
3. Select get from version control 
4. If your github is not signed in, sign in

## Glossary
* **Branch**- A version of the repository that diverges from the main working project. Branches can be a new version of a repository, experimental changes, or personal forks of a repository for users to alter and test changes. (acloudguru)
* **Clone**- A clone is a copy of a repository or the action of copying a repository. When cloning a repository into another branch, the new branch becomes a remote-tracking branch that can talk upstream to its origin branch (via pushes, pulls, and fetches). (acloudguru)
* **Fetch**- By performing a Git fetch, you are downloading and copying that branch’s files to your workstation. Multiple branches can be fetched at once, and you can rename the branches when running the command to suit your needs. (acloudguru)
* **Commit**- captures a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes. Committed snapshots can be thought of as “safe” versions of a project—Git will never change them unless you explicitly ask it to.(atlassian)
* **GIT**- a free and open source distributed code management and Version control system that is distributed under the GNU General Public License version 2. In addition to software version control, Git is used for other applications including configuration management and content management. (techtarget)
* **Github**- a distributed version-control platform where users can collaborate on or adopt open source code projects, fork code, share ideas and more.(techtarget)
* **Merge**- Taking the changes from one branch and adding them into another (traditionally master) branch. These commits are usually first requested via pull request before being merged by a project maintainer. (acloudguru)
* **Merge Conflict**- an event that takes place when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits.(simplilearn)
* **Push**- Updates a remote branch with the commits made to the current branch. You are literally “pushing” your changes onto the remote.(acloudguru)
* **Pull**- If someone has changed code on a separate branch of a project and wants it to be reviewed to add to the master branch, that someone can put in a pull request. Pull requests ask the repo maintainers to review the commits made, and then, if acceptable, merge the changes upstream. A pull happens when adding the changes to the master branch. (acloudguru)
* **Remote**- A copy of the original branch. When you clone a branch, that new branch is a remote, or clone. Remotes can talk to the origin branch, as well as other remotes for the repository, to make communication between working branches easier. (acloudguru)
* **Repository**- In many ways, you can think of a Git repository as a directory that stores all the files, folders, and content needed for your project. What it actually is, is the object database of the project, storing everything from the files themselves, to the versions of those files, commits, deletions, et cetera. Repositories are not limited by user, and can be shared and copied (see: fork). (acloudguru)
